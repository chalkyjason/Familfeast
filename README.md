## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Xcode 15.0+**
- **iOS 17.0+ SDK**
- **Apple Developer Account** (for CloudKit)
- **OpenAI API Key** (optional, for AI features)
- **Spoonacular API Key** (optional, for pricing data)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chalkyjason/Familfeast.git
   cd FamilyFeast
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open Package.swift
   # OR create a new iOS App project and copy the Sources/ directory
   ```

3. **Configure CloudKit**
   - In Xcode, select your target
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Add "iCloud" capability
   - Enable "CloudKit"
   - Create or select a CloudKit container: `iCloud.com.yourteam.familyfeast`

4. **Set up API Keys**

   **Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended for Development)**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key"
   export SPOONACULAR_API_KEY="your-spoonacular-key"
   ```

   **Option 2: Create Secrets File**
   Create `Sources/Utilities/Secrets.swift`:
   ```swift
   enum Secrets {
       static let openAIKey = "your-openai-api-key"
       static let spoonacularKey = "your-spoonacular-api-key"
   }
   ```
   ⚠️ **Important**: Add `Secrets.swift` to `.gitignore`

5. **Build and Run**
   - Select a simulator or device
   - Press `⌘R` to build and run
   - Sign in with an iCloud account when prompted

### First-Time Setup

1. **Create Family Group**
   - Launch the app
   - Follow the onboarding wizard
   - Name your family group

2. **Invite Family Members**
   - Go to Family tab
   - Tap "Invite Family Member"
   - Enter email or phone number
   - They'll receive an iCloud invitation

3. **Add Your First Recipe**
   - Tap "+" in Recipes tab
   - Enter manually or use AI suggestion
   - Add ingredients and instructions

4. **Start a Voting Session**
   - Go to Plan tab
   - Create a new meal session
   - Add candidate recipes
   - Family members vote via swipe interface

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
# Via Xcode
⌘U

# Via command line
swift test
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Voting algorithm (Borda Count)
- ✅ Consensus metrics calculation
- ✅ Schulze method ranking
- ✅ Budget constraint filtering
- ✅ Performance tests for large datasets

## 📊 Voting Algorithm Explained

FamilyFeast uses a **Modified Borda Count** system to achieve consensus:

### Vote Values
- **Super Like** (❤️): +2 points
- **Like** (👍): +1 point
- **OK** (✋): 0 points
- **Dislike** (👎): -100 points (soft veto)
- **Veto** (❌): Disqualified (hard constraint, e.g., allergy)

### Selection Process
1. **Nomination**: Head of Household or AI selects 15-20 candidate recipes
2. **Deliberation**: Family members vote asynchronously
3. **Resolution**: Algorithm calculates scores and selects top N recipes
4. **Ratification**: HoH schedules winning recipes to specific days

### Why This Works
- **Prevents polarization**: Disliked recipes score negatively, even if some love them
- **Rewards consensus**: Recipes that everyone is "OK" with often win over divisive choices
- **Respects strong preferences**: Allergies/restrictions get absolute veto power

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **End-to-End Encryption**: CloudKit uses Apple's encryption for all synced data
- **No Account Creation**: Uses existing iCloud credentials
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally with optional cloud sync
- **Secure Invitations**: CloudKit handles invitation verification
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: Zero analytics or tracking SDKs
